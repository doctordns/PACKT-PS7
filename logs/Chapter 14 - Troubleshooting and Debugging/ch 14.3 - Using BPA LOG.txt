Problem    : The primary domain controller (PDC) emulator operations master in this forest is not configured
             to correctly synchronize time from a valid time source.
Resolution : Set the PDC emulator master in this forest to synchronize time with a reliable external time 
             source. If you have not configured a reliable time server (GTIMESERV) in the forest root domain, 
             set the PDC emulator master in this forest to synchronize time with a hardware clock that is installed
             on the network (the recommended approach). You can also set the PDC emulator master in this forest to 
             synchronize time with an external time server by running the 
             w32tm /config /computer:DC1.Reskit.Org /manualpeerlist:time.windows.com /syncfromflags:manual /update command. 
             If you have configured a reliable time server (GTIMESERV) in the forest root domain, set the PDC emulator 
             master in this forest to synchronize time from the forest root domain hierarchy by running 
             w32tm /config /computer:DC1.Reskit.Org /syncfromflags:domhier /update.

Problem    : Some organizational units (OUs) in this domain are not protected from accidental deletion.
Resolution : Make sure that all OUs in this domain are protected from accidental deletion.

Problem    : The directory partition DC=Reskit,DC=Org on the domain controller DC1.Reskit.Org has not been backed up        
             within the last 8 days.
Resolution : To ensure that recent system state backups are available to recover Active Directory data that was recently 
             added, deleted, or modified, perform daily backups of all directory partitions in your forest or keep the      
             time between Active Directory backups to a maximum of 8 days.

Problem    : The directory partition CN=Configuration,DC=Reskit,DC=Org on the domain controller DC1.Reskit.Org has not      
             been backed up within the last 8 days.
Resolution : To ensure that recent system state backups are available to recover Active Directory data that was recently    
             added, deleted, or modified, perform daily backups of all directory partitions in your forest or keep the      
             time between Active Directory backups to a maximum of 8 days.

Problem    : The directory partition CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=Reskit,DC=Org on the domain controller DC1.Reskit.Org    
             has not been backed up within the last 8 days.
Resolution : To ensure that recent system state backups are available to recover Active Directory data that was recently    
             added, deleted, or modified, perform daily backups of all directory partitions in your forest or keep the      
             time between Active Directory backups to a maximum of 8 days.

Problem    : The directory partition DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=Reskit,DC=Org on the domain controller DC1.Reskit.Org has not     
             been backed up within the last 8 days.
Resolution : To ensure that recent system state backups are available to recover Active Directory data that was recently    
             added, deleted, or modified, perform daily backups of all directory partitions in your forest or keep the      
             time between Active Directory backups to a maximum of 8 days.

Problem    : The directory partition DC=ForestDnsZones,DC=Reskit,DC=Org on the domain controller DC1.Reskit.Org has not     
             been backed up within the last 8 days.
Resolution : To ensure that recent system state backups are available to recover Active Directory data that was recently    
             added, deleted, or modified, perform daily backups of all directory partitions in your forest or keep the      
             time between Active Directory backups to a maximum of 8 days.

Problem    : The Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) server role on the domain controller DC1.Reskit.Org is installed  
             on a virtual machine (VM).
Resolution : Make sure that the domain controller DC1.Reskit.Org complies with the best practice guidelines that are        
             described in the Help to avoid performance issues and replication and security failures in the Active
             Directory environment
