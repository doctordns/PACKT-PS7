PS C:\Foo> New-PSSession @S1HT

New-PSSession: [DC1] Connecting to remote server DC1 failed with the 
following error message : The WinRM client cannot process the request. 
CredSSP authentication is currently disabled in the client configuration. 
Change the client configuration and try the request again. CredSSP a
uthentication must also be enabled in the server configuration. 
Also, Group Policy must be edited to allow credential delegation to 
the target computer. Use gpedit.msc and look at the following policy: 
Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> System -> Credentials Delegation -> 
Allow Delegating Fresh Credentials.  
Verify that it is enabled and configured with an SPN appropriate 
for the target computer. For example, for a target computer name 
"myserver.domain.com", the SPN can be one of the following: 
WSMAN/myserver.domain.com or WSMAN/*.domain.com For more information, 
see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.
